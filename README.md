Developed a Python-based network traffic analysis tool using Scapy to capture and analyze live packets in real-time. The tool provides insights into network traffic patterns by analyzing protocol distribution, communication between IP addresses, and identifying potential security threats like port scanning. Leveraged data visualization techniques with Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective representation of protocol distribution and IP communication behavior
